# tide_inundation
Repository for using rtide + pressure sensors to predict reef inundation
Using the rtide package we should be able to pull the predicted tides for Cedar Key and then compare those tides to the "thresholds" from the construction project.  That part is basically done.  The next step would be to bring in the information that links observed pressure and the depth conversion from the DIVER sensors to relate predicted tidal height to different locations on the reef where the DIVERS are located such as station 1 or 3.  We could then use this to help think about things such as "if the average elevation of reef 17 is lower than the average elevation of reef 3, how does that relate to innundation time of the reef at different times of year".
