# tide_inundation
Repository for using rtide and related packages to predict the amount of time the Lone Cabbage reef and related areas are exposed.  The "working time" file includes the ability to calculate both the "working time" that the tide is below/above a specified elevation point, and then pulls the daylight information to tell you how much of that working time is actually during the day time.  That is useful.  
Eventually we should be able to use this info + pressure sensors to predict reef inundation to bring in the information that links observed pressure and the depth conversion from the DIVER sensors to relate predicted tidal height to different locations on the reef where the DIVERS are located such as station 1 or 3.  We could then use this to help think about things such as "if the average elevation of reef 17 is lower than the average elevation of reef 3, how does that relate to innundation time of the reef at different times of year".
